#### Courses 

Cucumber Hybrid Framework using Selenium 4 Java 

**[Online course by QAFox:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlfkOIwhOVg&t=20148s)**
I've learned how to leverage Selenium WebDriver with Python to automate web browser interactions for software testing. Now I can write scripts that mimic user actions on websites, like clicking buttons, filling out forms, and submitting data. This automation helps me efficiently test web applications and uncover potential bugs.
