In this portfolio, I will be sharing the tasks and assignments that I have completed as part of my learning and mastery of some of the most useful tools for Manual QA testers. I have always been interested in technology, and I have been actively seeking to enhance my skills in this field by learning and exploring various tools and techniques.
