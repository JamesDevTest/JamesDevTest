Cucumber Hybrid Framework using Selenium 4 Java 

**[Online course by QAFox:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlfkOIwhOVg&t=20148s)** 
I've learned how to leverage Selenium WebDriver with Python to automate web browser interactions for software testing. Now I can write scripts that mimic user actions on websites, like clicking buttons, filling out forms, and submitting data. This automation helps me efficiently test web applications and uncover potential bugs. 


The Complete Python Course | Learn Python by Doing in 2025

**[Online course by teclado:](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-python-course/?couponCode=ST13MT80425G3)** 
From foundations to expert, learn about every major Python topic, working with Python 3. I have learned Object-Oriented Programming to Automate extracting data from websites using web scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup and Selenium. Interact with REST APIs using Python. Learn how to write desktop applications with Python and Tkinter. **[LINK](https://github.com/JamesDevTest/JamesDevTest/blob/main/Examples/Test%20Generator/TestGen.md)** (Example of Tkinker app to extract data and automatically produce test scripts)


ISTQB Foundation Level (CTFL) V4.0 + Practice Exams - 2024

**[Online course by Maged Koshty:](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-tester-foundation-level-ctfl/?couponCode=ST13MT80425G3)**  
The course Prepared for the ISTQBÂ® foundation level certification exam and helped me pass first time. **[LINK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bl_gXPpuOrVlUdU5mtKB10PxigDfr5zM/view?usp=sharing)** (ISTQB Certification)


Playwright with Python | PyTest framework with Playwright

**[Online course by AutomationNeemo:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUsLSeg4O_w&list=PLP5_A7hnY1Tggph0F0cRqf5iyyZuIBXYC&index=11)** 
I learned how to automate browser actions using Playwright with Python, including launching browsers, locating elements, handling user interactions, and working with waits and assertions. The course covered integrating Playwright with PyTest for structured, scalable testing, using fixtures for setup and teardown, and running tests efficiently. I also explored recording tests with Playwright Codegen, handling complex scenarios like alerts and file uploads, and generating reports. Overall, the course provided a solid foundation in end-to-end test automation using modern tools.
