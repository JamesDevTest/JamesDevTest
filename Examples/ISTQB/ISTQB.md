# ISTQB Study Self Test Tool

Below is an example of a VBA script that i used to test myself before i sat the ISTQB test. I collected lots of mock test from around the internet and converted them into a usable format in excel.

The tool lets me choose which test i want to practice with using a dropdown box. I can see the progress as i go through the test by displaying my score and what question number i am on and after i answer a question shows me if i am incorrect or not.

You can choose to no show the pass/fail result after every question making it closer to the real test.

At the end of the test you will see your score in a popup
