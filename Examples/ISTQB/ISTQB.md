# ISTQB Study Self-Test Tool

Below is an example of a VBA script I used to prepare for the ISTQB exam. I gathered various mock tests from across the internet and converted them into a format that could be easily used within Excel.

The tool allows me to select the test I want to practice with via a dropdown menu. As I progress through the test, it tracks my score and indicates the current question number. After answering each question, the tool immediately shows whether my answer was correct or incorrect.

For a more realistic experience, you can choose to hide the pass/fail result after each question, mimicking the actual test conditions.

At the end of the test, a popup will display your score.

Additionally, a full list of all questions, highlighting the ones you answered incorrectly, will be shown.

If any diagrams are part of the test, they will appear on the right-hand side. If the images are blurry or cramped, you can click on them to view them in full size.
