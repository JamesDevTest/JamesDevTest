# Jira (WIP)

# Example of bug report

* In this example, I'm importing test cases from excel into jira

I selected 'Import from File' from the Test Cases tab in Zephyr, accessible under the More dropdown. Then, I chose a CSV file containing my test cases. If your CSV file includes field names in the first row, make sure to check the box labeled 'This row contains field names' before proceeding. Finally, click Next to continue with the import.

You'll need to map the fields from your CSV file to the corresponding fields in Jira to ensure your test scripts contain the correct information. The CSV fields appear on the right side of the screen, so simply select the matching Jira fields on the left. Click Next, and if any additional data mapping is required, you'll be prompted to complete it on the following screen before selecting Import.

If the import is successful, youâ€™ll see a confirmation screen. If any issues occur, double-check that the fields and data have been mapped correctly. Once imported, the new test scripts will appear in Zephyr.

* Test Plan and Cycle need to be setup to hold the scripts.

I have only 2 Test cases in this cycle before i imported more.
