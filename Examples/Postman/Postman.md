# Test Script Generator

Below is an example of a VBA script that Grabs a screenshot using ScreenClipping. It takes current cell and uses the cell reference to rename the screen captuer so the image is always associated with the correct step. I uses the cell height and width to resize the image to fit into the cell so you can easily start adding second or third screenshots for each test step in a row while keeping the test script clean and neat.

* `POST` : in this example, I'm sending a `JSON` body that contains the details of the new user and expect a response body and a `200 OK` response status code
