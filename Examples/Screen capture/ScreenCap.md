# Test Script Screen capture

Below is an example of a VBA script that captures a screenshot using ScreenClipping. The script uses the currently selected cell to name the screenshot, ensuring it’s always linked to the correct test step. It also resizes the image to match the cell’s height and width, allowing you to add additional screenshots (such as second or third captures) in the same row while keeping the test script organized and visually tidy.

Select the cell where you want the image to appear, then click the Capture Image button to begin screen capturing. The screenshot will be automatically inserted into the selected cell.

Click on the screenshot to toggle between its original size and the resized view.

Adding additional screenshots next to the first one is just as simple.

Continuing to the next step and adding new screenshots is just as easy.

Since the screenshot is named using the cell reference, if it’s accidentally moved elsewhere in the spreadsheet, simply clicking on the image will return it to its correct cell.

If a screenshot is captured for the wrong test step, you can easily relocate it by selecting the image, clicking the Move Image button, and then choosing the correct cell.
