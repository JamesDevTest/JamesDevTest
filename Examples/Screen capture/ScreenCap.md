# Test Script Generator

Below is an example of a VBA script that Grabs a screenshot using ScreenClipping. It takes current cell and uses the cell reference to rename the screen captuer so the image is always associated with the correct step. I uses the cell height and width to resize the image to fit into the cell so you can easily start adding second or third screenshots for each test step in a row while keeping the test script clean and neat.

Select the cell to hold your image and press on the Capture Image button to start you screen capturing. The screenshot will be captured to the cell.

You can click on the screenshot to enlarge the image back to the original size and back again.

Adding more than one screenshot next the the first is just as easy.

And continuing to next step and adding new screenshots is easily done.

As the cell reference is used to name the screenshot if by chance a screen shot if accidentally moved somewhere on the spreadsheet it can esily find the correct cell it belongs by simply pressing on the screenshot.

If a screenshot is taken for the wrong test step you can move the screenshot to the correct position by selecting it and pressing the Move Image button and then selecting the correct cell to move it to.
